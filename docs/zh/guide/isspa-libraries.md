# ISSPA Libraries(Python and C++)

Some common tools will be integrated into ISSPA in the form of Python Packages or CPP Libraries, the purpose of which is to interconnect ROS packages and give you a clearer insight into how ISSPA works. In the meantime, you will also understand ISSPA’s program logic and how it relates to each other. Let’s start following along with the tutorial.

The tutorial includes the following:

- ISSPA Python Packages

    - Creation Method

    - Usage Examples

- ISSPA C++ Libraries

    - Usage Examples

# ISSPA Python Packages
First, you need to understand how to create a Python Package in ROS and how other ROS packages import it. Second, you will be introduced to the basic usage of Python Package with code samples.

## Creation Method
Here’s an example of creating a python package named `isspa`, which also has the package name `isspa`. Create a `setup.py` file in the root directory of the ROS package, i.e., the directory on a level with `CMakeLists.txt`:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/ISSPA/src
cd ~/ISSPA/src
catkin_create_pkg isspa rospy roscpp std_msgs
cd isspa
touch setup.py
touch scripts/isspa/__init__.py
touch scripts/isspa/logging_output.py
chomd +x scripts/isspa/logging_output.py
```

The contents of the `setup.py` file are as follows:

```shell
from distutils.core import setup
from catkin_pkg.python_setup import generate_distutils_setup


d = generate_distutils_setup(
    packages=['isspa'],
    package_dir={'': 'scripts'},
    version='0.1.0'
)

setup(**d)
```

Only two sentences are important here, the rest are the same every time:
```shell
packages=['isspa'],
package_dir={'': 'scripts'},
The first sentence indicates the name of the package, and the second sentence indicates the directory where the package is located.
```
::: tip NOTE
The version should be consistent with the version of the package in the package.xml file.
:::


The contents of the `logging_output.py` file are as follows:
```shell
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy

def logger(msg):
    rospy.loginfo("Welcome to ISSPA. " + msg)
```

After that, you also need to change the contents of `CMakeLists.txt`:
```shell
...

catkin_python_setup()

catkin_package()

...
```

Finally, you need to build the package:
```shell
cd ~/ISSPA
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
If all goes well, you can try running the program in another package. A simple test is as follows:
```shell
# Open a new terminal
roscore

# Open another terminal, and create a script file
cd  ~/ISSPA/src/
catkin_create_pkg test_import_python_package rospy roscpp std_msgs
cd test_import_python_package/scripts
touch test_import_python_package.py
chomd +x test_import_python_package.py
```

Below we add a simple `test_import_python_package`.py script under `~/ISSPA/src/test_import_python_package/scripts` as an example.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
from isspa import logging_output

def test_log():
    logging_output.logger("This is a test message.")
    rospy.loginfo("Welcome to ISSPA! This is a message from test_import_python_package.py")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rospy.init_node('test_import_python_package')
    test_log()
```
And, run the following command to make the script executable:

```shell
# In another terminal
rosrun test_import_python_package test_import_python_package.py
```
The following results will be output:

```shell
[INFO] [1632938655.753961]: Welcome to ISSPA. This is a test message.
[INFO] [1632938655.758263]: Welcome to ISSPA! This is a message from test_import_python_package.py
```

# ISSPA C++ Libraries
The ROS library configuration for C++ is more complex than for python, so let’s learn how to create it!

## Creataion Method
Here’s an example of creating a C++ library named `isspa`, which also has the head file named `util.h`.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/ISSPA/src
cd ~/ISSPA/src
catkin_create_pkg isspa rospy roscpp std_msgs
cd isspa
mkdir include
touch include/isspa/util.h
```

The contents of the util.h file are as follows:
```shell
#ifndef UTIL_H
#define UTIL_H

#include "ros/ros.h"

namespace isspa
{
    namespace utils {
        void logger(const char* msg);
    }
} // namespace isspa

void sayHello();

#endif // UTIL_H
```
::: tip NOTE
Don’t misspell `#ifndef` as `#ifdef`. , otherwise the contents of the header file will not be found during compilation.
:::



Then create `util.cpp` in the `~/ISSPA/src/isspa/src` folder with the following contents:

```shell
#include "isspa/util.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

namespace isspa
{
    namespace utils {
        void logger(const char* msg)
        {
            cout << "[Welcome to ISSPA util] " << msg << endl;
        }
    }
} // namespace isspa

void sayHello()
{
    ROS_INFO("Hello from util.cpp");
}
```

After that, you also need to change the contents of `CMakeLists.txt` within `isspa` package:

```shell
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.2)
project(isspa)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
)

catkin_package(
INCLUDE_DIRS include
LIBRARIES isspa
CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp rospy std_msgs
)

include_directories(
include
${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

add_library(${PROJECT_NAME}
src/util.cpp
)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
${catkin_LIBRARIES}
)

install(TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME}
ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_GLOBAL_BIN_DESTINATION}
)

install(DIRECTORY include/${PROJECT_NAME}/
DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}
)
```

At this point, the other package requires changes to `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml`, assuming the name of the other ROS package is `test_import_roscpp_library`:

We need to create a `main.cpp` file first.

```shell
cd ~/ISSPA/src/
catkin_create_pkg test_import_roscpp_library rospy roscpp std_msgs
cd test_import_roscpp_library/src
touch src/main.cpp
```
A simple example is as follows:

```shell
// main.cpp
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <isspa/util.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    ros::init(argc, argv, "test_import_roscpp_library");
    ros::NodeHandle nh;

    isspa::utils::logger("Hello from main.cpp");
    sayHello();

    return 0;
}
```
After that, you also need to change the contents of `CMakeLists.txt` within `test_import_roscpp_library` package:

```shell
...

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
isspa
)

...

add_executable(test_import_roscpp_library src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(test_import_roscpp_library ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

...
```
And add a `<depend>isspa</depend>` tag inside the `package.xml`.

Finally, you need to build the package:

```shell
cd ~/ISSPA
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
If all goes well, you can try running the program in another package. A simple test is as follows:

```shell
# Open a new terminal
roscore

# In another terminal
rosrun test_import_roscpp_library test_import_roscpp_library
```
The following results will be output:

```shell
[Welcome to ISSPA util] Hello from util.cpp
[INFO] [1632938655.757961]: Hello from util.cpp
```
