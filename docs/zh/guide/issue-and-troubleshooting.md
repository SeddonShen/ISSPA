# Issue and Troubleshooting
## During ISSPAâ€™S Compilation
### Issue A
When running catkin_make, the local environment conflicts with the conda virtual environment.

**Error Message:**

```shell
-- This workspace overlays: /opt/ros/noetic
-- Found PythonInterp: /home/iscas/anaconda3/bin/python3 (found suitable version "3.11.5", minimum required is "3")
-- Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /yourhost/anaconda3/bin/python3
-- Using Debian Python package layout
-- Could NOT find PY_em (missing: PY_EM)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/catkin/cmake/empy.cmake:30 (message):

```
**Cause Analysis:**

Since there is a Python environment in the locally installed anaconda, catkin_make uses python in the conda environment by default, which is incompatible with the python version required in the ros environment.

### Solution A
There are two ways to solve the above problem:

1. In bashrc or zshrc, comment out the `anaconda` part, and then reactivate the conda environment when using conda in the future.

2. When using `catkin_make`, specify the python interpreter, for example `catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3`.
