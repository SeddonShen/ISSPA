## Preface

The proper deployment and standardized use of sensors are crucial for the stable operation of autonomous vehicles, as the quality of their data significantly impacts the safety of vehicle navigation. In the field of autonomous driving, the array of sensors typically includes industrial cameras, LiDAR, mm-wave radar, GPS, IMU, each with distinct data formats.

## ISSPA's configuration

ISSPA's vehicles can be equipped with single/multi-line LiDAR, mono/depth cameras, IMU, providing researchers with a diverse range of options to meet their specific needs. Brief introductions to different sensors are as follows:

- **LiDAR**: LiDAR utilizes laser beams to get distances by measuring the reflection time. Widely used in autonomous driving, LiDAR contributes to real-time mapping, object detection. Below is a frame of point cloud from one campus using velodyne's 16-line LiDAR.

- **Depth Camera**: Depth cameras based on Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology use the principle of measuring the flight time of light pulses to determine the distance between objects and the camera. ToF depth cameras offer advantages of speed, accuracy, and adaptability to various lighting conditions. They find widespread applications in computer vision, 3D scanning, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: IMU provides information about a vehicle's attitude and motion state by measuring acceleration and angular velocity. In autonomous driving systems, IMU is commonly used to enhance navigation accuracy and stability.
