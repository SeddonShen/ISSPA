# Compilation Tools

## Historical Overview
A build system in ROS (Robot Operating System) refers to a set of functional programs or scripts designed to automate and simplify the compilation and linking of source code. ROS build systems, evolving over the years, are built on top of CMake, a meta-build system generating native makefiles and workspaces. This doc explores the history of ROS build systems, starting with rosbuild and culminating in the latest system, colcon.

## rosbuild (Legacy)
rosbuild consists of scripts for managing the CMake-based build system in ROS. The CMake wrapper script, rosmake, is crucial for building ROS. Most commonly used ROS packages have transitioned to the recommended catkin build system. A package using rosbuild is identified by the presence of a manifest.xml file, containing information such as cpp cflags and dependencies.

To build packages with rosbuild, the command is:

```shell
rosmake <package1> <package2> <package3>
```
## catkin_make
catkin_make is a commonly used command for building ROS workspaces. It is a convenient way to invoke calls to CMake and make in the standard CMake workflow. The entire workspace is treated as a single CMake project, making incremental builds faster.

Limitations of catkin_make include its inability to **process plain CMake packages** and the requirement for **all targets in the workspace to be unique**.

## catkin_make_isolated
catkin_make_isolated improves on catkin_make by building isolated workspaces. Each software package is independently configured, built, and installed into its own directory. This allows for the removal of the install artifacts of a single package by deleting its directory.

Building with catkin_make_isolated involves creating an isolated ROS catkin workspace, adding the isolated package, and then compiling using:

```shell
catkin_make_isolated
```
## catkin_tools
catkin_tools, similar to catkin_make_isolated, builds packages in topological order and in parallel where possible, resulting in improved build times. It treats each package as a separate CMake project and catches common build errors using persistent build metadata.

Supported command line verbs include build, clean, configure workspace settings, create packages, run commands with a modified environment, initialize a workspace, list package information, locate workspace directory paths, manage named configuration profiles, test packages, and more.

## colcon
colcon is a command line tool for building, testing, and using multiple software packages in ROS. It supports building different types of packages on different operating systems and is actively developed for both ROS 1 and ROS 2 workspaces.

Building a workspace with colcon creates build, install, and log directories. It represents the latest ROS build tool and can handle various package types such as CMake, Python setuptools, cargo, gradle, etc.

::: tip NOTE
Tip: If you have a project that requires both catkin_make and catkin_make_isolated packages, it is recommended that you place the project that uses catkin_make_isolated in the root directory, e.g., /opt/ros/, and add its directory to ~/.bashrc, so that you can you can easily make changes or additions to the launch file.
:::



If your project is compiled using catkin_make_isolated and the launch file has been modified, you can recompile it using the following command:

```shell
catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja
```

Alternatively, you can use the following command to recompile the entire project:

```shell
catkin_make_isolated --only-pkg-with-deps cartographer_ros --install
catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=Yes
```

## Conclusion
ROS build systems have undergone continuous evolution, from the traditional rosbuild to the current state-of-the-art colcon, enhancing efficiency and flexibility in software development for robotics.
