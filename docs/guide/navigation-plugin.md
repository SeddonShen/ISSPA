# Navigation Plugin


## Current Listings
As of now, ISSPA has integrated some baseline algorithms as shown below:

| Global Planner | Local Planner |
|----------------|---------------|
| A*             | TEB           |
| D*             | DWA           |
| PSO            | ...           |

::: tip NOTE
    PSO: Particle Swarm Optimization; 
    TEB: Timed Elastic Band; 
    DWA: Dynamic Window Approach;

## Adding Plugins
The structure of the document has been designed in ISSPA and you can contribute to us by following the tutorials below.
Just use `isspa_navigation_plugin` as the name of your algorithm:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/pa_ws/src && cd ~/pa_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/chenhengwei1999/ISSPA.git
cd ISSPA/src/isspa_navigation
catkin_create_pkg isspa_navigation_plugin rospy roscpp std_msgs
```

Then, you can add your own algorithm in the `isspa_navigation_plugin` package.

Once you have added it, you can compile the feature package with the help of the `catkin_make` tool to see if it is 
available and if it runs smoothly. If it runs successfully, you can refer to the Github Pull Request to submit your merge request.
