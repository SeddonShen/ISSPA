ISSPA (Intelligent Self-driving System empowering Physical Agents) is an experimental platform for self-driving physical agents.

## Introduction

ISSPA (Intelligent Self-driving System empowering Physical Agents) is an experimental platform for self-driving physical agents, which was originally designed to facilitate researchers by creating baseline solutions that are easy to use, algorithmically verifiable, and modularly extensible. And it was built under the leadership of the [TIS Lab](https://tis.ios.ac.cn/), of which the team members are listed in [Team](https://isspa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about_us/team.html).
